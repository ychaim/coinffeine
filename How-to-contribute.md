## Introduction

This wiki page describes the details on how to contribute to Coinffeine. 

## Contribute with Bug Reports

As humans, we are not perfect. And our code is not perfect too. You may contribute to Coinffeine by submitting bug reports using [Github issue tracking](https://github.com/BitwiseLabs/coinffeine/issues/new). Please make sure the description of the issue is as much detailed as possible and use the appropriate tags to contextualize it. 

## Contribute with Code

You may contribute to the project by coding new features, fixing bugs, improving the codebase, etc. We use Github pull requests to code collaboratively as follows.

1. First, [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the Coinffeine repository into your own account. 
2. Then, you clone a working copy of the forked repo in your computer. It is highly recommendable to add original repository as a remote named `upstream` to have the latest updates from the repo. 
3. Make sure your `master` branch contains the latest changes pulled from the upstream repository. It's highly recommented to create a new branch from the updated master for each change you want to make to the code. 
4. Now make changes to the code and commit them. Use a [well formed commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) to document the change. 
4. Push your changes to origin (i.e., the repository you forked on step 1)). 
5. Go to Github page and submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). 
6. Your changes will be reviewed and commented in Github. Reply to any question and comment. Surely there will be suggestions of change. If so, make the changes to your code to address the suggestions and add them to the appropriate commit by amending it. When you're done, force a push to your forked repository so the amended commit can be reviewed. 
7. When all the feedback to the pull request has been addressed, the reviewers will give their LGTM (look good to me). Then, your code will be merged into the `master` branch of the original Coinffeine repository. 
8. Repeat from step 3).
